    "  Inside it:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `__init__.py` marks the directory as a package, allowing imports like `import textutils`.\n",
    "  * `core.py` is where you will implement the main functionality of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`tests/`** – this folder contains all the **automated tests** for your code.\n",

    "### Exercise 0 — Team Setup & Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Create and share a collaborative GitHub repository where your team will develop the project together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial setup is fundamental: it defines your working environment and ensures that every teammate has access to the same shared codebase. From this point on, all changes will be version-controlled, traceable, and synchronized through GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decide team roles.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Choose one student to act as the **repository owner**.\n",
    "   * The owner will create the repo and manage access.\n",
    "   * All other teammates will be **collaborators**, with full permission to push and pull changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the repository.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The owner goes to [https://github.com](https://github.com) → **New Repository**.\n",
    "   * Name it `textutils-<teamname>` (for example: `textutils-1`).\n",
    "   * Set it as **Public** (so it can be accessed for evaluation).\n",
    "   * Add a `.gitignore` for Python and a short description like:\n",
    "\n",
    "     > “Small Python package for text utilities — group assignment.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add collaborators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In the repository page, go to\n",
    "     **Settings → Collaborators → Add people**,\n",
    "     and invite the other teammates by their GitHub usernames.\n",
    "   * Each collaborator will receive an email invitation to accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clone the repository (everyone).**\n",
    "   Once the invitation is accepted, every team member should clone the repository to their local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/<owner>/textutils-<team>.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will create a local copy of the shared project on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Open it in VS Code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Launch **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "   * Choose **File → Open Folder**, and select the cloned project folder.\n",
    "   * Open the **Source Control** tab (on the left sidebar) to check that Git is active and your main branch (`main`) is visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this exercise**, every team member should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **working clone** of the same repository,\n",

    "### Exercise 1 — Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Set up the **basic structure of your project repository** following the conventions of a small, testable Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a clear and consistent folder layout is essential for teamwork: it helps everyone know *where to put code*, *where to put tests*, and *how the project should be run or imported*.\n",
    "This structure also mirrors how professional Python projects are typically organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to your local project folder.**\n",
    "   Open your cloned repository in **VS Code** (you should see it in the Explorer sidebar).\n",
    "   Open a terminal inside VS Code (**Ctrl + `**) — you should be in the project root (check with `pwd`or`cd`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the folder structure.**\n",
    "   You will now create three key directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   src/textutils/\n",
    "   tests/unit/\n",
    "   tests/integration/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The `src/` folder contains your **production code**, that is, the real implementation of your package.\n",
    "   * The `tests/` folder contains your **test code**. It is split into:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `unit/` for *individual function tests*, written in a test-driven-development (TDD) style.\n",
    "     * `integration/` for *broader tests* that check how the parts of your code work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can create these folders using the VS Code file explorer or the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir -p src/textutils tests/unit tests/integration\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create the initial placeholder files.**\n",
    "   Inside those folders, add the following empty files to define the project layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `src/textutils/__init__.py` → marks the directory as a Python package.\n",
    "   * `src/textutils/core.py` → will contain the main functions for this assignment.\n",
    "   * `tests/unit/test_core.py` → where you’ll write your first unit tests.\n",
    "   * `tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py` → where you’ll later create a combined integration test.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can create them quickly from the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch src/textutils/__init__.py src/textutils/core.py \\\n",
    "         tests/unit/test_core.py tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify that the structure looks right.**\n",
    "   In the file explorer or by running `tree` (or `ls -R`), you should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   textutils/\n",
    "   ├─ src/textutils/__init__.py\n",
    "   ├─ src/textutils/core.py\n",
    "   ├─ tests/unit/test_core.py\n",
    "   ├─ tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stage, commit, and push your work.**\n",
    "   Record your progress in Git so that your teammates can fetch it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add .\n",
    "   git commit -m \"chore: create initial project structure\"\n",
    "   git push\n",

    "   After pushing, check on GitHub that the folders and files appear correctly.\n",

    "### Exercise 2 — Create and Export the Micromamba Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Create a **reproducible Python environment** so that everyone in the team is using the same interpreter, Python version, and libraries — and then **export** that environment to a file (`environment.yml`) that can be shared through GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in groups, reproducibility is crucial: if one teammate installs a different Python version or a missing dependency, the code may work on one computer but fail on another.\n",
    "Micromamba helps you avoid this problem by isolating your project’s dependencies in a clean, lightweight environment that can be recreated by anyone with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the environment manually**\n",

    "   # Activate it\n",

    "\n",
    "   >  **Tip:** You can list all existing environments with\n",
    "   > `micromamba env list`\n",
    "   > and deactivate the current one with\n",
    "   > `micromamba deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install the required packages**\n",
    "   Every project needs tools for testing and coverage measurement.\n",
    "   Here we install `pytest` (for running tests) and `pytest-cov` (for tracking code coverage).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Core testing tools\n",
    "   micromamba install pytest pytest-cov -y\n",

    "   Alternatively, you can also use `pip` inside the environment:\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install pytest pytest-cov\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   > 💬 **Why this step matters:**\n",
    "   > By installing these libraries inside the micromamba environment, we make sure everyone in the team has **the same versions** of these tools.\n",
    "   > This prevents “it works on my machine” situations.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Export the environment to a file**\n",
    "   Once your setup works, create a file that describes it — this file allows your teammates (and the instructor) to recreate the exact same environment on their computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   micromamba env export > environment.yml\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "---\n",

    "5. **Commit and push the environment file**\n",
    "   Add the file to Git so that everyone can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add environment.yml\n",
    "   git commit -m \"build: export and add environment.yml\"\n",
    "   git push\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now your teammates can reproduce your environment at any time with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   micromamba create -f environment.yml -y\n",
    "   micromamba activate textutils\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Configure VS Code to use this environment**\n",
    "   Finally, tell VS Code to run Python and tests using your new micromamba environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Open the **Command Palette** (**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P**)\n",
    "   * Type and select **Python: Select Interpreter**\n",
    "   * Choose the interpreter whose path includes your `textutils` environment\n",

    "* `reverse_words(text)` — reverse the order of words, not characters.  \n",
    "* `capitalize_sentences(text)` — ensure each sentence starts with a capital letter.  \n",
    "* `word_lengths(text)` — return a dict mapping words to their lengths.  \n",
    "* `strip_accents(text)` — remove accents from characters (e.g., café → cafe).  \n",
    "* `slugify(text)` — convert text to lowercase, hyphen-separated safe string.  \n",
    "* `count_vowels(text)` — count vowels in the given text.  \n",
    "* `camel_to_snake(text)` — convert CamelCase identifiers to snake_case.  \n",
    "* `truncate(text, n)` — shorten text to n characters, adding “...” if needed.  \n",
    "* `collapse_duplicates(text, char)` — replace runs of the same char with one.  \n",
    "* `is_anagram(a, b)` — check if two texts are anagrams (ignore case and spaces).  \n",
    "* `compare_texts(text1, text2)` — compute similarity based on common word ratio.  \n",
    "* `replace_numbers(text)` — replace digits with their word equivalents (2 → two).  \n",
